When working with the netCDF-C codebase, use the `netcdf-architecture` skill to understand:
- Dispatch table architecture and format implementations (NetCDF-3, HDF5, Zarr, DAP)
- I/O layer interactions and metadata structures
- How different storage backends work together
- Debugging format-specific issues
- Adding new features or modifying existing ones

Invoke the skill when:
- Answering questions about netCDF-C architecture or internals
- Making significant changes to core NetCDF-C code
